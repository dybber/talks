Title: TAIL: Typed Array Intermediate Language

Abstract:

In this talk I will present a compiler for a subset of the classical
array programming language APL, developed at DIKU, University of
Copenhagen, as part of the HIPERFIT-research project.

The compiler translates APL programs into a typed array intermediate
language, called TAIL, which is equipped with a shape-polymorphic type
system and an operational semantics. For various benchmarks, we
demonstrate the feasibility of compiling TAIL further into code that
can execute on parallel architectures.

Recently, we have added support for annotating APL programs with
types. The benefits of this extension will also be discussed.
