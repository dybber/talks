Title:

Coding Pirates: Teaching kids programming and IT-creativity



Abstract:

Coding Pirates is a Danish initiative teaching kids computing in its
broadest sense. We believe that programming should not just be taught
as an independent discipline. We should teach it along with creativity
and design skills.

Projects range from 2D/3D games, Arduino based 3D-printed submarine,
computer generated music, stop-motion videos, to a creepy doll for a
haunted house. Such projects not only requires programming, but also
skills in graphics, 3D modelling, 3D printing, basic electronics,
musicality, and especially creativity!

Coding Pirates is volunteer run and we host a Coding Pirates chapter
here at DIKU, with most of our teachers being DIKU alumni. In addition
to describing the general concept and ideology, the talk will also
cover what we have learned so far, what we see as the difficulties
ahead, and why I think it is important for DIKU and University of
Copenhagen to participate in this movement.

Facts:
 * 30+ code clubs all over Denmark
 * 1000+ kids on the waiting list
 * 300+ volunteers (teachers, IT-professionals, librarians, IT-students)
 * regular Hackathons and GameJams for the kids
