Coding Pirates: Teaching kids programming, IT-creativity and modern tech
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract:

Coding Pirates is a Danish initiative where volunteers teach kids to
use their computers not as consumers, but as producers. Our
philosophy, which might be a bit different from other initiatives, is
that we should not just teach programming as a completely separate
discipline. Instead we are teaching the kids to be creative,
innovative and combine various skills to make their project ideas come
true.

Projects range from 2D/3D games, LEGO Mindstorm robots, Arduino based
3D-printed submarine, computer generated music, to a creepy doll for a
haunted house. Such projects not only requires programming, but also
skills in graphics, 3D modelling, 3D printing, basic electronics,
musicality, and especially: creativity!

In addition to describing the general concept and ideology, the talk
will also cover how we run the weekly sessions in practice. I will
also mention what we have learned so far, what we see as the
difficulties ahead, and why DIKU, the Department of Computer Science
at University of Copenhagen, has involved itself so deeply in this
endeavour.

You will also get a brief look at visual programming language Scratch,
which is where most of our kids start, and you will see examples of
projects by some of our young programmers.

Facts:
 * 24 code clubs all over Denmark
 * around 6 new code clubs starting January 2016
 * more than 500 kids on the waiting list
 * more than 225 volunteers (teachers, IT-professionals, librarians, IT-students)
 * regular Hackathons and GameJams for the kids
